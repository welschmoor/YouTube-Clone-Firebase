# YouTube Clone

This is my attempt to make a YouTube clone using Firebase for backend.


Current progress: https://fir-610f8.web.app/


Frontend: `React`
CSS: `Styled Components`
Backend: `Firebase`


## Set Up
Create a Firebase project on firebase.com. In /src/firebase/index.js change the config to the one from firebase website. In project `npm i firebase@8.5`, make sure to use this version of firebase.


To run, in root folder run `npm install` and the site should be available on port localhost:3000
